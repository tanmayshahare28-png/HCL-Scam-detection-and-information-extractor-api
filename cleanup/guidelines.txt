Problem Statement 2 
Agentic Honey-Pot for Scam Detection & Intelligence 
Extraction 
1. Introduction 
Online scams such as bank fraud, UPI fraud, phishing, and fake offers are becoming 
increasingly adaptive. Scammers change their tactics based on user responses, making 
traditional detection systems ineffective. 
This challenge requires participants to build an Agentic Honey-Pot — an AI-powered system 
that detects scam intent and autonomously engages scammers to extract useful intelligence 
without revealing detection. 
2. Objective 
Design and deploy an AI-driven honeypot system that can: 
● Detect scam or fraudulent messages 
● Activate an autonomous AI Agent 
● Maintain a believable human-like persona 
● Handle multi-turn conversations 
● Extract scam-related intelligence 
● Return structured results via an API 
3. What You Need to Build 
Participants must deploy a public REST API that: 
● Accepts incoming message events 
● Detects scam intent 
● Hands control to an AI Agent 
● Engages scammers autonomously 
● Extracts actionable intelligence 
● Returns a structured JSON response 
● Secures access using an API key 
4. API Authentication 
● x-api-key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY 
● Content-Type: application/json 
5. Evaluation Flow 
1. Platform sends a suspected scam message 
2. Your system analyzes the message 
3. If scam intent is detected, the AI Agent is activated 
4. The Agent continues the conversation 
5. Intelligence is extracted and returned 
6. Performance is evaluated 
6. API Request Format (Input) 
Each API request represents one incoming message in a conversation. 
6.1 First Message (Start of Conversation) 
This is the initial message sent by a suspected scammer. There is no prior conversation history. 
{ 
“sessionId”: “wertyu-dfghj-ertyui”, 
"message": { 
"sender": "scammer", 
"text": "Your bank account will be blocked today. Verify immediately.", 
"timestamp": 1770005528731 
}, 
"conversationHistory": [], 
  "metadata": { 
    "channel": "SMS", 
    "language": "English", 
    "locale": "IN" 
  } 
} 
6.2 Second Message (Follow-Up Message) 
This request represents a continuation of the same conversation. 
Previous messages are now included in conversationHistory. 
{ 
“sessionId”: “wertyu-dfghj-ertyui”, 
  "message": { 
    "sender": "scammer", 
    "text": "Share your UPI ID to avoid account suspension.", 
    "timestamp": 1770005528731 
  }, 
  "conversationHistory": [ 
    { 
      "sender": "scammer", 
      "text": "Your bank account will be blocked today. Verify immediately.", 
      "timestamp": 1770005528731 
    }, 
    { 
      "sender": "user", 
      "text": "Why will my account be blocked?", 
      "timestamp": 1770005528731 
    } 
  ], 
  "metadata": { 
    "channel": "SMS", 
    "language": "English", 
    "locale": "IN" 
  } 
} 
6.3 Request Body Field Explanation 
message (Required) 
The latest incoming message in the conversation. 
Field Description 
sender scammer or user 
text Message content 
timestamp ISO-8601 format 
conversationHistory (Optional) 
All previous messages in the same conversation. 
● Empty array ([]) for first message 
● Required for follow-up messages 
metadata (Optional but Recommended) 
Field 
channel 
language 
locale 
Description 
SMS / WhatsApp / Email / Chat 
Language used 
Country or region 
7. Agent Behavior Expectations 
The AI Agent must: 
● Handle multi-turn conversations 
● Adapt responses dynamically 
● Avoid revealing scam detection 
● Behave like a real human 
● Perform self-correction if needed 
8. Agent output should be like  
{ 
} 
"status": "success", 
"reply": "Why is my account being suspended?" 
9. Evaluation Criteria 
● Scam detection accuracy 
● Quality of agentic engagement 
● Intelligence extraction 
● API stability and response time 
● Ethical behavior

 No impersonation of real individuals 
● 
❌
 No illegal instructions 
● 
❌
 No harassment 
● 
✅
 Responsible data handling 
11. One-Line Summary 
Build an AI-powered agentic honeypot API that detects scam messages, handles 
multi-turn conversations, and extracts scam intelligence without exposing detection. 
12. Mandatory Final Result Callback (Very Important) 
Once the system detects scam intent and the AI Agent completes the engagement, 
participants must send the final extracted intelligence to the GUVI evaluation endpoint. 
This is mandatory for evaluation. 
Callback Endpoint 
POST https://hackathon.guvi.in/api/updateHoneyPotFinalResult 
Content-Type: application/json 
Payload to Send 
Participants must send the following JSON payload to the above endpoint: 
{ 
"sessionId": "abc123-session-id", 
"scamDetected": true, 
"totalMessagesExchanged": 18, 
"extractedIntelligence": { 
"bankAccounts": ["XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"], 
"upiIds": ["scammer@upi"], 
"phishingLinks": ["http://malicious-link.example"], 
"phoneNumbers": ["+91XXXXXXXXXX"], 
"suspiciousKeywords": ["urgent", "verify now", "account blocked"] 
}, 
"agentNotes": "Scammer used urgency tactics and payment redirection" 
} 
 
 
When Should This Be Sent? 
You must send this only after: 
1. Scam intent is confirmed (scamDetected = true) 
2. The AI Agent has completed sufficient engagement 
3. Intelligence extraction is finished 
This should be treated as the final step of the conversation lifecycle.
