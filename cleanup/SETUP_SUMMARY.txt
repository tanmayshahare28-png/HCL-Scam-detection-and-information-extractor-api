# Honeypot API Monitoring System - Complete Setup

## Current Status
- **API Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000
- **Ngrok Tunnel**: Public URL: https://edmond-toadless-agelessly.ngrok-free.dev
- **Monitoring Script**: Running with multiple notification methods

## Notification Configuration
Due to captive WiFi restrictions, email notifications may not work reliably. The system is configured to use SMS notifications via email-to-SMS gateway.

### To Configure SMS Notifications:
1. Run `setup_sms_notifications.bat`
2. Enter your phone number (digits only)
3. Enter your carrier (verizon, att, tmobile, sprint, etc.)

Or manually edit the monitor_honeypot_with_email.ps1 file:
- Find the line: `$smsGatewayEmail = "YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER@vtext.com"`
- Replace with your actual phone number and carrier gateway
- Example: `$smsGatewayEmail = "1234567890@txt.att.net"` for AT&T

## Common SMS Gateways
- Verizon: number@vtext.com
- AT&T: number@txt.att.net
- T-Mobile: number@tmomail.net
- Sprint: number@messaging.sprintpcs.com
- Virgin Mobile: number@vmobl.com
- Boost Mobile: number@myboostmobile.com
- Cricket: number@sms.cricketwireless.net
- Metro PCS: number@mymetropcs.com

## Monitoring Capabilities

## 6-Day Operation Assurance
